# NutellaMarket

(by AC)
Hello there so in fact i think only my friend will see this so I will not 9up that much.
Basiclly, it is such a great game, and I strongly recommend you to play it during the boring ICT lesson (if it is boring)

Here is something you must read b4 downloading: 
1. I recommend you to download the .exe version
2. I do not recommend you to download the .py version because every line of my stupid code is shit and it will make u want to die

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and then here is some history for the game? I guess?:

  20240314 Joe release v1.0 of this
  
  20240605 I (AC) just rewrite everything into the v2.0 (cuz I don't really like Joe type of code) and I guess I also improve the game a lot (That mean only the basic idea of Joe's originally game is kept.), and I gonna said that I really enjoy this
  
  20240607 I just made it into v2.1 and I forget what I add
  
  20250427 A year is passed and I decide to fix some bug in the previous game (for no reason), and I decide to make this github repository so all of you can freely download all the versions of this NutellaMarket game.


good
